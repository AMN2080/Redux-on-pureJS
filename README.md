# [Demo without modular structure](https://codepen.io/AMN2080/pen/ZEdrxrW)

This mini-project is a simple implementation of the Redux library using pure JavaScript.

In this mini-project, Redux is implemented from scratch without using any external libraries like React or Redux itself.

**The mini-project is designed as a tutorial and a simple example to demonstrate the core concepts of Redux and to provide a better understanding of how state management works in JavaScript applications.**
